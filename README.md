# Tic Tac Toe

Welcome to my very first app for Android.

This is just a simple app for users to play the simple game called Tic Tac Toe. The rules are simple,
the first one to get 3 (X) or (O) whether vertically, horizontally or diagonally on the 3x3 board
wins and if there's no space left on the board it's a tie. 

# Features
- Play for as long as you can - users don't need to specify the amount of rounds they wanna play and
can simply end whenever they're satisfied.

- Play with a friend or a computer - users can choose to either play with a friend or a computer AI.

- Avatars - besides the default avatars on the app, users can also use any of their own photos in 
their phones as avatars. The opponent can also customize if the opponent is a human player.   

- Scoreboards - both sides can check the amount of times they've won for the current match.

- Rankings - users can check the rankings of the match. The ranking is based on the amount of times
the user won against the opponent.

# Notes
This app was made long ago while I was still learning both Java and Android Development and is 
considered completed even though the code have obvious flaws such as boilerplate code, breaking the
DRY principle and no architecture whatsoever.

With that said, this app will no longer receive updates from me and is just something for me to look
back to for a good laugh on how I code back then so feel free to do so as well.
